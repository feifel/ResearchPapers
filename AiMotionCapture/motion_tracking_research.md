## Introduction

Creating realistic fitness animations for virtual reality requires accurate motion tracking that maintains fidelity when viewed from multiple angles. Traditional approaches like QuickMagic AI Motion capture and DeepMotion have limitations when users change viewing perspectives—a critical issue for fitness applications where proper form observation is essential.

This research explores solutions that address these challenges, focusing on technologies compatible with WebXR development for Meta Quest 3, mobile AR, and PC browsers. The goal is to identify motion tracking options that balance accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and ease of integration into WebXR workflows.

## Meta Quest 3 Motion Tracking Capabilities

The Meta Quest 3, released in October 2023 with ongoing updates through 2025, offers several built-in tracking capabilities relevant to fitness applications:

### Inside-Out Body Tracking (IOBT)

Meta Quest 3 implements **inside-out body tracking** using the headset's cameras to track upper body movements without external sensors:

- **Upper Body Tracking**: Accurately tracks torso, elbows, and wrists with support for nuanced gestures like leaning or twisting
- **Generative Legs**: Uses AI to estimate lower body movements based on upper body data, enhancing social presence without requiring additional hardware
- **Limitations**: Cannot yet support precise leg tracking or crossing legs, which remains a hardware challenge

### Hand and Controller Tracking

The Quest 3 offers advanced hand tracking capabilities:

- **Hand Tracking v2.2**: Reduces latency by 40-75% compared to previous versions, making hand interactions more natural and fluid
- **Wide Motion Mode (WMM)**: Expands the tracking volume by utilizing upper body tracking to estimate hand positions when outside the camera's field of view
- **Multimodal Tracking**: Allows simultaneous tracking of hands and controllers, enabling users to switch seamlessly between precise controller input and natural hand gestures

### Head and Positional Tracking

- **6DoF (Six Degrees of Freedom)**: Ensures precise positional tracking of the headset, allowing users to move naturally within their environment
- **Controller Tracking**: Uses infrared LEDs and internal gyroscopes/accelerometers for accurate tracking, even when controllers are partially occluded

### Software and SDK Support

Meta has released SDK updates, such as the **Meta XR Core SDK v62**, which enable developers to implement advanced tracking features. These SDKs facilitate integration of body and hand tracking into VR applications, making natural interactions more accessible and realistic.

### Limitations for Fitness Applications

While Quest 3's tracking is impressive, some limitations affect fitness applications:

- Full, precise leg tracking remains hardware-limited, with current solutions relying on AI estimation
- Hand tracking accuracy can degrade when hands are outside the camera's view or obstructed
- Crossing legs or minor movements like raising knees are not yet supported due to hardware constraints
